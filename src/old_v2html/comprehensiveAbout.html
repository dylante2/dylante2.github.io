I done wrestled with an alligator. That's right. I have wrestled with an alligator. I done tussled with a whale. I done handcuffed lightning, thrown thunder in jail. That's bad!

				<li><div><span class= "time">May 2019</span> <span class = "title">Jane Street SEE</span>
					<span class = "description">In early March, a friend of mine told me to apply to this program Jane Street was hosting called SEE (Spring Educational Event). I applied, though skeptical that I had what it took for the company. <br><br>Lo and behold, I was able to move through the interview stages and got accepted. Out of 2000+ applicants, me and 31 other students had the opportunity to travel to NYC (all expenses paid) and learn about various market basics, probability concepts, and most importantly, arbitrage. <br><br>Meeting everyone else was enough to make the trip worth it. But most importantly, I left the trip feeling a much higher self-worth. I realized that I was much more capable than  I thought. Personally, I think the fact that I went to Pitt and not some top 10 powerhouse school really elicited a lot of self doubt, but my time at Jane Street really helped see through this and I'm forever grateful </span></div></li>
				<li><div><span class= "time">April 2019</span> <span class = "title">Facet Lab @ Pitt LRDC</span>
					<span class = "description"> This summer I get to continue my work in automated NLP grading systems with Dr. Erin Walker. I'm currently in the process of designing and implementing my own novel auto-grader system. The system will help promote peer-to-peer tutorship between students on an interactive online forum. Interested? Hit me up with an email and I'd love to go further in-depth on the project. </span></div></li>
				<li><div><span class= "time">December 2018</span> <span class = "title">Litman Lab @ Pitt LRDC</span>
					<span class = "description">  Accepted into Pitt's First Experience in Research program and got matched with Dr. Diane Litman, who is one of the most accomplished CS Professors at Pitt. Our project was called Automatic Essay Scoring and was such a great experience to be apart of. Learned the principles of NLP and Machhine Learning, and got to create my own NLP features to assist the Machine Learning model. An awesome semester and forever grateful for my RA for telling me about Pitt's FER program.</span></div></li>

				<li><div><span class= "time">July 2018</span> <span class = "title">EssMed...Part 2</span>
					<span class = "description">  Was offered to work remotely for EssMed while I was at school. Took it because I knew it wouldn't be that much work and I wouldn't mind getting some income during school. Also looks better on resume...right? </span></div></li>	
				<li><div><span class= "time">May 2018</span> <span class = "title">Essential Medical, Inc</span>
					<span class = "description">  Was given the opportunity to intern at my neighbor's startup and I took it immediately. Spent the majority of my time working on Crystal Reports and ERP implementation within the office, which was pretty boring. However, I loved working with the people there and doing the various odd tasks that working at startups brings. </span></div></li>
				<li><div><span class= "time">February 2018</span> <span class = "title">University of Pittsburgh</span> 
					<span class = "description"> After a few more rejections, Pitt was the only viable school I could commit to. Was extremely disappointed in myself when I did it, but I'm so glad I made the choice. Feeling like a big fish in a small pond is not something I've ever experienced before, and I'm using that to keep myself working hard. H2P baby </span></div></li>
				<li><div><span class= "time">December 2017</span> <span class = "title">College Admissions</span> 
					<span class = "description"> Got rejected by 10 schools in two months, even by those that I thought I could've gotten in. I had good test scores, incredible extracurriculars, and revised every essay I wrote with my English teacher (bless her heart), but GPA was still too low and I suffered from it. </span> </div></li>
				<li><div><span class= "time">September 2017</span> <span class = "title">AP Computer Science</span> 
					<span class = "description"> Learned Java from an awesome teacher. Took this class seriously, and though I struggled in the beginning, everything began to click at the end of the year. Got a 5 on the exam, which let me skip 2 intro classes at Pitt (so clutch)</span></div></li>
				<li><div><span class= "time">August 2017</span> <span class = "title"> Senior Success (kinda) </span>
					<span class = "description">  Took 5 APs senior year and had to spend the year writing college essays. Grades at first were slightly improved, but at the end I really got how to study and what not. <br>In two years I raised my weighted GPA from a 3.4 to 4.0. I also joined Pit Orchestra this year, and it was the most fun I had playing the cello since getting 1st chair at states in 5th grade. Track team went undefeated for the first time while I was in HS and I won the Best Hurdler award (along with the school's fastest 110 Hurdles time). It was very satisfying seeing my hard work pay off (for the most part) and my previous blunders caused a lot of maturing on my side.</span></div></li>
				<li><div><span class= "time">September 2016</span> <span class = "title">Intro to Python</span>
					<span class = "description">  First real programming class I took. At this point I decided I wanted to major in Computer Science, but the class wasn't incredibly well taught and I didn't learn much about Python. </span></div></li>
				<li><div><span class= "time">August 2016</span> <span class = "title">Junior Jump (Forward)</span> 
					<span class = "description"> Took 4 APs my junior year and also had SAT school the summer prior. My GPA didn't increase as I had wanted to, but that's simply because the courses were much tougher than the ones I took before. Ended up learning how to study and the importance of hard work.</span></div></li>
				<li><div><span class= "time">January 2016</span> <span class = "title">Sophomore Slump</span> 
					<span class = "description"> My midterm report card for sophomore year was a B-,C+,C,D+,D, and the rest of the year didn't go any better. I was way too overworked with daily track practice and weekly cello lessons, but I'm glad it happened so early. After sophomore year I vowed to not repeat what happened that year, no matter what.</span></div></li>
				<li><div><span class= "time">June 2010</span> <span class = "title">Random Courses.</span> 
					<span class = "description"> Took a "Web Dev" and a Scratch course at Summer Camp. The courses were pretty uninspiring, but I did mess around with Scratch after.</span></div></li>
